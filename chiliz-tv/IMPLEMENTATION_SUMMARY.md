- Migration roadmap
- Chainlink integration plan

### 2. Smart Contract (`src/betting/MatchBettingOdds.sol`)
**Features Implemented:**

```

### 3. Test Suite (`test/MatchBettingOddsSimple.t.sol`)
**10/10 Tests Passing ✅**

Test scenarios include:
- ✅ Basic bet and win with 2.0x odds
- ✅ House profit scenario (losers fund winners less than staked)
- ✅ Multiple bets same user (each with locked odds)
- ✅ Odds change between bets (early bettors get better odds)

**Example Test Odds Used:**
```
Football:
- Home 1.8x, Draw 3.2x, Away 2.5x (realistic)
- Home 1.5x, Draw 4.0x, Away 3.5x (heavy favorite)

UFC:
- Champion 1.1x, Challenger 9.5x (extreme underdog)
- Red 1.15x, Blue 6.5x (heavy favorite scenario)
```

### 4. Liquidity Management Plan (`LIQUIDITY_PLAN.md`)

## 📊 How It Works

### User Flow
```
1. Match initialized with odds:
   - Home 2.5x
   - Draw 3.0x  
   - Away 2.0x

2. User bets 1000 CHZ on Home @ 2.5x
   → Locked in: Will receive 2500 CHZ if Home wins

3. Admin updates odds to Home 2.3x
   (odds moved due to market conditions)

4. Another user bets 1000 CHZ on Home @ 2.3x
   → Locked in: Will receive 2300 CHZ if Home wins

5. Match settles: Home wins ✅

6. First user claims: 2500 CHZ payout
   Second user claims: 2300 CHZ payout
```

### Treasury Flow
```
Scenario 1: House Profits
- Total staked: 10,000 CHZ
- Total payouts: 6,000 CHZ
- House profit: 4,000 CHZ → Sent to treasury

Scenario 2: House Loses
- Total staked: 10,000 CHZ
- Total payouts: 15,000 CHZ
- House loss: 5,000 CHZ → Treasury funds contract with 5,000 CHZ
```

## 🔑 Key Differences from Current System

| Feature | Current (Parimutuel) | New (Fixed Odds) |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| **User knows payout** | ❌ No (calculated after betting closes) | ✅ Yes (locked at bet time) |
| **Odds change** | ✅ Constantly until cutoff | ✅ Yes, but each bet locks in current rate |
| **Liquidity risk** | ❌ None (peer-to-peer) | ✅ Yes (house provides) |
| **Profit model** | Platform fee only (2-5%) | House edge in odds (3-7%) + optional fee |
| **UX** | Poor (uncertain outcome) | Excellent (known payout) |
| **Competitiveness** | Low vs sportsbooks | High vs sportsbooks |
| **Implementation** | Simple | Complex (liquidity mgmt) |

## 💰 Economics

### Revenue Model
```
Example Match with 100,000 CHZ volume:

Odds with 5% House Edge Built In:
- Fair odds: Home 2.0x → House offers 1.90x
- Fair odds: Away 2.0x → House offers 1.90x

If balanced book (50k on each side):
- One side loses: 50,000 CHZ
- Other side wins: 50,000 / 1.90 = 26,316 CHZ bet × 1.90 = 50,000 CHZ payout
- Wait, let me recalculate...

Actually with 1.90x odds:
- 50,000 CHZ on Home → Potential payout: 95,000 CHZ
- 50,000 CHZ on Away → Potential payout: 95,000 CHZ

If Home wins:
- Collected: 100,000 CHZ
- Paid out: 95,000 CHZ
- House profit: 5,000 CHZ (5%)

If Away wins:
- Collected: 100,000 CHZ
- Paid out: 95,000 CHZ
- House profit: 5,000 CHZ (5%)

Balanced book = guaranteed profit! 🎯
```

### Staker Returns (Community Staking)
```
Staking Pool: 500,000 CHZ
Your stake: 10,000 CHZ (2% of pool)

Monthly volume: 1,000,000 CHZ
House edge: 5% = 50,000 CHZ profit
To stakers: 80% = 40,000 CHZ
Your share: 2% × 40,000 = 800 CHZ

Monthly return: 800 / 10,000 = 8%
Annual APR: 8% × 12 = 96% APR ⚡

(This assumes balanced books and consistent volume)
```

## 🛡️ Safety Features Implemented

### 1. Liquidity Protection
```solidity
// Prevents accepting bets that exceed available liquidity
if (currentLiability + potentialProfit > maxLiability) {
    revert InsufficientLiquidity();
}
```

### 2. Minimum/Maximum Bet Limits
```solidity
// Enforces $5 USD minimum via Chainlink price feed
uint256 usdValue = PriceOracle.chzToUsd(msg.value, priceFeed);
if (usdValue < minBetUsd) revert BetBelowMinimum();

// Prevents whale attacks with max bet limit
if (msg.value > maxBetAmount) revert BetAboveMaximum();
```

### 3. Odds Validation
```solidity
// Prevents odds below 1.0x (losing bet for house)
if (newOdds < 10000) revert InvalidParam();
```

### 4. Settlement Verification
```solidity
// Only authorized settlers can resolve matches
function settle(uint8 winning) external onlyRole(SETTLER_ROLE) {
    // Calculates exact house P&L
    // Emits for transparency
}
```

### 5. Reentrancy Protection
```solidity
// All external calls protected
function claim() external nonReentrant {
    // Safe CHZ transfers via low-level call
}
```

- Concentration per outcome
- Consecutive losses
- Worst single match loss

### Recommended Dashboards

**Admin Dashboard:**
- Real-time treasury balance
- Upcoming match liabilities

## 🤝 Community Governance (Future)

### Potential DAO Structure
```
Governance Token: vCHZ (vote-locked CHZ)

Voting Power:
- 1 vCHZ = 1 vote
- Earned by staking in liquidity pool
- Used to vote on:
  - Maximum liability changes
  - New sports additions
  - Fee structure
  - Emergency actions
```

### Proposed Governance Scope
1. **Adjust risk parameters** (max liability, bet limits)
2. **Add new sports/markets**
3. **Change fee distribution** (stakers vs treasury vs operations)
4. **Emergency pause triggers**
5. **Treasury management** (what to do with excess reserves)
